# Once fits are working locally (following README), you can run on lxbatch using these commands.

# This generates the commands to run. Change grid to whatever signal grid you want...

./ToolKit/batch/generateOptimisationSRs.py --grid=GG_direct --entire-grid

# This is a bit sloppy, but run the submission script in a "dry_run" mode to create the worker scripts
# Run on the json file produced by the above command

./ToolKit/batch/runOptimisation.py -f optimisation/optimisation-XXXXXXX.json --dry_run

# This thing is making scripts that aren't excecutable which pisses off lxbatch. So fix it with...

chmod +x Jobs/*sh 

# Then you can submit it. 

./ToolKit/batch/runOptimisation.py -f optimisation/optimisation-XXXXXXXXX.json 

# Then you can convert these into json with

python makeJSON.py optimisation-XXXXXXXX/results/
