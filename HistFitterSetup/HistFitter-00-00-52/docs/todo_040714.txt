To-do-list HistFitter 9. September 2015

############
#All tasks:#
############


>>> High priority:

- Documentation on how to setup HistFitter and ROOT on different operating systems (ubuntu done, complete mac instructions)
- Revision: the Tutorial/documentation could be a more practical-oriented. 
 o Update contour plot example
 o Update FAQ and main HistFitter twiki pages
- Advertizement and examples for combination of workspaces. ---> Partially DONE
- Migration into ATLAS release
- Harmonize the various plotting and batch/grid submission scripts. 
- Migrate to uncapped p0 values. 
- toys versus asymptotic - add possibility to assess fit information on toys
- Investigate 'method 3' from Higgs group for systematics tables
- Memory issue reported for loading many histograms at the grid by Katharina Behr

>>>>>From old to-do list:
- Proper treatment of all bins with zero events by HistFactory? Check (See recent mail George Lewis)
- sigma values in list-file. 
- Hard-coded names, e.g. sig_xsection. Needs to be documented, or made flexible. 
- Generalized scripts --- for plotting in particular



>>> Next: Useful additions & Extra documentation:

- Analysis script sharing/generalization/
  o in particular for contour plot scripts, also update those in the trunk
  o add option to run contour plots to HistFitter.py
- Correct statistical treatment of fits to prescaled data. 
- Clean-up of C++ and python code (see work packages by statistics forum)
- Add possibility to produce HEPData material
- Add pull plot for parameters to HistFitter
- Provide functions/tools to do fitting/plotting of arbitrary workspaces, also not following the naming convention by HistFitter
- feature request: generalization of pull plot macro, possible based on pickle format as in Geert-Jan's example macro
- parallelization for histogram construction and for producing toys

>>> On slightly longer time-scale:

- Manpower situation. Rotation of mailing-list help. 
- Python code cleanup: implement polymorphic design for Systematic and Sample python config objects
